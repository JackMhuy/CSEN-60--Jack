# UX/UI Design Lecture

## Notes:
<p><u> Usability: Measure how a person can: </u></p>
<ul>
<li>navigate an interface </i>
<li>achieve a goal </i>
<li>find information </li>
</ul>

<p><u>Common Usability Problems:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Long text (can't be read quickly)
<li>Cluttered or otherwise poor layout
<li>Requires horizontal scrolling, or makes
<li>assumptions about user's screen size
<li>Poorly chosen colors
<li>Poor or missing navigation controls 
</ul>
<p><u>Content Usability Problems:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Most important content isn't on the first page
<li>Nondescript headings
<li>Too many ads (or things that appear to be ads)
<li>Important site content in non-HTML format
<li>Isn't designed to be easily indexed by a search engine (HTML title, meta tags, page text, link text, etc.)
<li>Tiny thumbnails of detailed large photos 
</ul>
<p><u>Design Principles</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Place name and logo on every page and make the logo a link to the home page
<li>Provide search if the site has more than 100 pages (Documentation/Wiki)
<li>Write straightforward and simple page titles that clearly explain what the page is about

<li>Avoid cramming everything into a single infinite page with no navigational tool
</ul>
